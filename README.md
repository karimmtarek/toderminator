# Todermonator
A todo list application with Rake automation.
It does one thing, one thing only! it helps you manage your todo lists, and if you can't manage them it'll terminate them one by one for you, for free. You are welcome.

### Use case
Todermonator aims to keep to-do lists manageable by automatically deleting to-do items that have not been completed after seven days. The hypothesis is that if the to-do item is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it doesn't belong on your to-do list.

### Demo
Demo application can be found [there](http://toderminator.herokuapp.com/).
